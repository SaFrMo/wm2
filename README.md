# The White Mask
Artists using "smart graffiti" have a responsibility to know everything they can about how their art communicates with the living world - since smart graffiti can watch, listen, and even interact with its surroundings, there's plenty of opportunity for hijacking and misusing the art, especially with the enormous money and power that the oppressive government and its supporters can bring to bear.

This is where you come in.

You're a hacker whose experience with smart graffiti lets you find all the vulnerabilities any mural has left exposed - open doors, poor security, and more are all ready to be patched up for good after you put murals through every trial you can think of.

Stay one step ahead of malicious hackers, government and otherwise, as you protect artists, their audience, and their work, sneaking a glimmer of hope into a cruel and controlled atmosphere.
